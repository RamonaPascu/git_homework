*/ Git + GitHub Homework Assignment
Objective:
Get hands-on experience using Git and GitHub to understand version control processes and collaborative coding techniques.

Prerequisites:
Git is installed on your computer.

A GitHub account.

Tasks:
Set Up a Local Repository:

Create a new folder called "git_homework" on your computer.

Navigate into the folder using the terminal or command prompt.

Initialize a new Git repository in this folder.

Add Files and Commit:

In the "git_homework" folder, create a new text file named "README.md".

Write a brief description in the file about what you've learned in the Git + GitHub training.

Add this file to the Git staging area.

Commit the file with a meaningful commit message.

Create a GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository named "git_homework".

Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.

Link your local repository to this remote repository and push your commit.

Branching:

In your local repository, create a new branch named "feature".

Switch to the "feature" branch.

Create a new text file in the "git_homework" folder called "feature.txt".

Write a few lines about your favorite feature of Git or GitHub.

Add and commit this file.

Push the "feature" branch to your GitHub repository.

Pull Request:

On GitHub, create a new pull request to merge the "feature" branch into the "main" or "master" branch.

Review the changes and merge the pull request.

Pull the changes to your local "main" or "master" branch.

.gitignore:

Create a file in your local repository named ".gitignore".

Add "*.temp" to the file to ignore all files with a ".temp" extension.

Create a sample "data.temp" file in your repository to ensure it's ignored.
 
Commit the .gitignore file.

Clone and Explore:

Find a public repository on GitHub that interests you.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Explore its commit history, branches, and files.

Reflection:

Edit your README.md file to include:

Challenges you faced while completing the tasks.

New things you learned from the hands-on experience.

Any feedback or questions you might have about the training?

Final Push:

Add and commit your changes to the README.md file.

Push your changes to the GitHub repository. /*
